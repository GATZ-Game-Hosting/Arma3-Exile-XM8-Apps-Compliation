1. if you have a custom folder already in your mission.map.pbo than just put the xm8_apps folder into it.
   if you have a xm8_apps folder already in your custom folder then put the AirStrike folder into it.
   if you do not have a custom folder than put the whole custom folder into your mission.map.pbo

2. set up xm8 button similar to below example in config.cpp of mission.map.pbo

	//////////////EXAMPLE BUTTON//////////////////////////////////////////////
		class XM8_App06_Button: RscExileXM8AppButton1x1
		{
			textureNoShortcut = "custom\xm8_apps\AirStrike\airstrike.paa";
			text = "Air Strike";
			onButtonClick = "[] execVM 'custom\xm8_apps\AirStrike\AirStrike.sqf'";
			resource = "";
		};
	////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

3. edit the config.sqf found in this package to your liking. 
4. go to initPlayerLocal.sqf of mission.map.pbo and paste in the following
		
		[] execVM "custom\xm8_apps\AirStrike\AirStrike_init.sqf";

5. In the root of this XM8_APPS package you will find a @ExileServer folder go into it and from the
   addons folder copy out the airstrike.pbo and paste into your @ExileServer\addons of your server.
   this is used for respect and pop tab transfer between server and client there is no editing of this
   pbo.
   

	
   NOTE: you can change file paths to your own but you will need to make necessary changes in other files
		 within this package.
