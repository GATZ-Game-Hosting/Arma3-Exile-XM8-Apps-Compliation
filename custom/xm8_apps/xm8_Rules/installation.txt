1. if you have a custom folder already in your mission.map.pbo than just put the xm8_apps folder into it.
   if you have a xm8_apps folder already in your custom folder then put the xm8_Rules folder into it.
   if you do not have a custom folder than put the whole custom folder into your mission.map.pbo

2. set up xm8 button similar to below example in config.cpp of mission.map.pbo

	//////////////EXAMPLE BUTTON//////////////////////////////////////////////
		class XM8_App04_Button: RscExileXM8AppButton1x1
		{
			textureNoShortcut = "custom\xm8_apps\xm8_Rules\icon\rules.paa";
			text = "Server Rules";
			onButtonClick = "execVM 'custom\xm8_apps\xm8_Rules\code\rules_Load.sqf'";
			resource = "";
		};
	////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

3. edit the message.sqf found in this package to your liking. 
4. edit the rulesApp_Init.sqf from this package to set your button text and web links.

5. go to description.ext of mission.map.pbo and paste in the following
		
		#include "custom\xm8_apps\xm8_Rules\GUI\defines.hpp"
		#include "custom\xm8_apps\xm8_Rules\GUI\dialog.hpp"

6. go to initPlayerLocal.sqf of mission.map.pbo and paste in the following
		
		[]execVm "custom\XM8_APPS\xm8_Rules\rulesApp_Init.sqf";

7. Finally if you use infistar make sure you whitelist the IDD's for this App found in Idds_ForInfistar_Whitelist.txt
   otherwise regular non admin players will get the displays auto closed on them.
   IDD white list can be found in @infiSTAR_Exile on your server then In addons folder unpbo the a3_infiSTAR_Exile.pbo
   and open up EXILE_AHAT_CONFIG.hpp. Find the following and put in the idd accordinly.

		//////////Example of what to look for in infistar////////////////// 
			allowedIDDs[] =

   NOTE: you can change file paths to your own but you will need to make necessary changes in other files
		 within this package.
