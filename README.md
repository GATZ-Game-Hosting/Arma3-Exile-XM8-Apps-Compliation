# XM8-Apps-compilation
IMPORTANT:
  Almost all app folders inside the custom folder have thier own file named installation.txt if you do not have file extensions showing than
  you will probably only see it as installation. This is the install instructions for that specific xm8 app. You can install only the apps you
  want to use you are not requred to install them all.
  
Compilation of XM8 apps that were made to be standalone versions from Exad XM8
Some of these apps are my personal apps that I made and some will be from other
Devs that allow me to put them in this package. I have provided installation instructions
for each app so you will need to look in each apps folder and find Installation.txt within
each one because they all install a bit differently but Iam trying to keep them on one file
structure of custom/xm8_apps.

If you use my xm8 Air Strike app then you may want to check this new version out it has alot of
configurable changes in it as far as charging player by tabs or respect or even both. Also
the file structure has changed for the air strike so pay attention to it in this package.

Thank you Desa2k for allowing me to put in his Exad XM8 reworks of AI Scanner, AI Recruit, and Air Drop.
